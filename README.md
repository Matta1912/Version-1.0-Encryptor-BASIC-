Hi, this is a basic first project I have been working on utilizing rudimentary python knowledge.

The program itself is a text file Encryptor/Decryptor, having been through a few iterations and test versions, this is the first remotely polished version.

**Features Included at this point include;**
1. A switch for Dark Mode/Light Mode
2. A how to use button inside the program
3. Ability to Copy Key to clipboard
4. Separate Key saving, to store generated keys in .key format. (Used for the Key decryption)

As mentioned above, this is an incredibly rudimentary and basic program with very few complex features and QoL features as I'm still learning python. This program is closer to being considered a tech demonstration and practice.
If there are any suggestions or ideas to further improve this program feel free to drop some ideas into the dedicated inbox below
